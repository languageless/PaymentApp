Exercise application build with Grails.

Go to:

/PaymentApp/transaction/pay

in order to test the payment functionality

Follow the menu items to:

1. View transactions for each account
2. View the emails that have been sent out after each successful transaction

A mix of unit and integration tests has been added to demonstrate how controllers can be tested with either approach.
